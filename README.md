# [joshtronic](https://joshtronic.com) does `dotfiles`

These are my `dotfiles`. There are many like them, but these are mine. My
`dotfiles` are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must
master my life. My `dotfiles`, without me, are useless. Without my `dotfiles`, I
am useless.
